        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Aglio e Olio</strong> translate to garlic and oil, and is a simple sauce usually served with pasta like spaghetti.
            This is a traditional <b>Neopolitan</b> pasta that is popular for being inexpensive and using pantry ingredients.
            This recipe comes from the movie <em>Chef</em>, where Casper makes a lusciously oily, garlicky pasta for Molly.
