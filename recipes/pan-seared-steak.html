        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds New York Strip steaks</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Thoroughly pat steak dry with paper towels. Generously season with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Heat cast iron pan until hot then add oil over medium-high heat, swirl to coat. Once oil is very hot, add steak to pan. Sear steak on the first side for 4 minutes until a brown crust has formed, flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Turn steak on sides to render fat cap, sear edges.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and immediately add butter, garlic, and rosemary to pan. Spoon butter over the steak. Continue spooning butter over the steak for a minute until the steak is about 5-10 degrees from you desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover and rest for 10 minutes. Cut and serve.</li>
        </ol>
