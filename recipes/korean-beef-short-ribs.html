        <h2 class="page header main-header">Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Kalbi</strong> is a staple of Korean fine dining but too expensive in restaurants.
            It is simple to make at home and will leave your quests asking for more.
            Total time includes marinating time.
            It's <em>traditionally</em> served sliced, rolled in romaine lettuce leaves with white rice, lightly browned garlic slices, and gochujang (Korean red pepper paste).
